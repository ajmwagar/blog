## Personal Projects

#### Outrigger

**Co-Founder and Lead Developer 2017 - 2021**

We designed and built Outrigger to help people, including ourselves, achieve inbox life balance by creating some space to focus on whatever’s important.

Similar to Slack’s do not disturb or iOS’s do not disturb while driving, Outrigger’s auto-replies give the people who email you a button they can use to notify you if their message is urgent or becomes urgent later. You can receive Outrigger notifications via SMS (text) or Telegram, with Slack and other messengers coming soon. Using non-email notifications lets an Outrigger user be intentional about whether they really want to check their email in response to a notification.
