I have been going to hackathons since the middle of 2016 (I was 13 at the time.), at each one I learned something new that I use everyday.

# What is a hackathon?

For those of you who don't know, a **Hackathon** is a multi-day (usually 2-3 day) marathon where software developers team up to create an 
application or game in a limited amount of time.
At these hackathons there are usually judges and prizes for the top
3 applications, along with some category prizes.


# Who goes to hackathons?

People of all skills, and skill level attend. Teams need artists and audio
creators, programmers and team managers to get the job done in time.

Most hackathons are open to people of all skill levels. So whether you or your
teen is just beginning or is an experienced programmer, audio designer, etc.
it is still worth it to attend. 

# Why should you go to a hackathon?

> When it comes to learning, academia is a good nights sleep and hackathons are pure caffeine powder.
