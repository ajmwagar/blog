Founder of [Future Present Labs](https://fpl.dev). Building the infrastructure for agentic manufacturing — where AI agents design, quote, and fabricate real hardware.

Previously: Senior SRE at Oracle National Security Regions, Systems Development Engineer at AWS, startup engineer at Zipwhip.

Creator of [AgentRFQ](https://github.com/FuturePresentLabs/AgentRFQ), an open standard for agent-to-manufacturer requests. Currently operating 3D printing, waterjet, and CNC workflows in Seattle.

I write about systems, software, and the future of making things. Believer that software is just systems, and systems thinking applies everywhere — from engines to cloud infrastructure to supply chains.

## Outside of Work

**Sailing** — Racing in [Duck Dodge](http://www.duckdodge.org/) on my 1968 Coronado 25, *Theseus*. Big, blue, and slow, but always a good time.

Bought her off Craigslist after a friend talked me into it. Learned to sail at the [Center for Wooden Boats](https://www.cwb.org/) in two-hour lessons, then sailed home from Olympia, WA. Been a hell of an adventure.

**Motorcycles & Camping** — When not on the water, probably motorcycle camping or sailing the San Juan Islands.

**Winter** — Snowboarding at Snoqualmie, pretending it'll get sunny soon, or [building boats](/post/ariadne).
