Born and raised Seattlite. I write blog posts sometimes, which is probably why you are here.

Passionate about sailing, fishing, motorcycles, motorsports, camping, the works.

Collector of Vinyl records, esoteric transportation options, and bad jokes.

Professionally, I work in techonology. Mostly software, sometimes hardware. **Read more about my work [here](/about).**

In the summers, you can find me on Lake Union racing in [Duck Dodge](http://www.duckdodge.org/) on my 1968 Coronado 25, Theseus. Big, blue, and slow, but always a good time.

If I'm not there, I'm probably motorcycle camping or sailing in the San Juan Islands.

Wintertime, I snowboard, mostly Snoqualmie, and pretend it's gonna get sunny soon, or some winters I'll [build a boat](/posts/ariadne) instead.

Feel free to drop me a note [here](/contact) or follow me on social media (links to your left), but I'm not super responsive anymore on those platforms.
