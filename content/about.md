{{< figure src="/img/about/me.png" alt="Me, in Victoria B.C." position="center" style="width:800px;">}}

Born and raised Seattleite. I write blog posts and code, one of which is probably why you are here.

Passionate about sailing, fishing, motorcycles, motorsports, camping, the works.

Collector of vinyl records, esoteric transportation options, and bad jokes.

Professionally, I work in techonology. Mostly software, sometimes hardware. **Read more about my work [here](/work).**

In the summers, you can find me on Lake Union racing in [Duck Dodge](http://www.duckdodge.org/) on my 1968 Coronado 25, Theseus. Big, blue, and slow, but always a good time.

Good friend talked me into a sailboat. Bought it off Craigslist. Been a hell of an adventure.

Go check out the [Center for Wooden Boats in SLU](https://www.cwb.org/). I learned to sail there in two hour long lessons. Then sailed my new boat up from Olympia, WA.

If I'm not there, I'm probably motorcycle camping or sailing in the San Juan Islands.

Wintertime, I snowboard, mostly Snoqualmie, and pretend it's gonna get sunny soon, or some winters I'll [build a boat](/post/ariadne) instead.

Feel free to drop me a note [here](/contact) or follow me on social media (links to your left), but I'm not super responsive anymore on those platforms.
