This part of the guide will help you set up a modded Assetto Corsa setup.

## Content Manager

One of the most important first steps is to install [Content Manager][content-manager].

Content Manager is a custom launcher and content management app for Assetto Corsa. 

Some of key features include:
- Quick drive & career mode
- Online mode: favourite and hidden servers, players tagging, missing content download
- Real conditions
- Integrated RSR Live Timing, SRS and World Sim Series
- Flexible filters
- Content rating, driving statistics, best times from various sources
- Race results history
- Custom Showroom with various effects and features
- Ambient shadow updating
- Livery plates generation with fully customizable rules
- Car setups, Quick Drive, controls presets and replays sharing
- AC settings
- Extra commands to bind to joysticks, such as un-pause or go-to-pits, plus hardware steering lock option for some devices
- Support for Custom Shaders Patch: auto-install, auto-update, UI for settings
- Management for cars, car skins, showrooms, fonts, weathers and other types of content
- Repair tool for obsolete car mods or mods with common errors
- Content installation, built-in web-browser to find and quickly install new mods
- Car previews updating, using either Custom Showroom or AC Showroom
- Livery editor
- Weather editor

It can be found [here][content-manager]. 

Download the [zip file][content-manager-download] and extract it to a folder of your chosing. I chose (`D:/Assetto Corsa/Content Manager`) so it'll live with all my extra AC stuff.

## Customs Shader's Patch

Once you have installed Content Manager - installing CSP is easy

Navigate to Settings > Customs Shaders Patch, and hit install.
