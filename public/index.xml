Projects Outrigger Co-Founder and Lead Developer 2017-present
We designed and built Outrigger to help people, including ourselves, achieve inbox life balance by creating some space to focus on whatever’s important.
Similar to Slack’s do not disturb or iOS’s do not disturb while driving, Outrigger’s auto-replies give the people who email you a button they can use to notify you if their message is urgent or becomes urgent later.</description>
